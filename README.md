# Random-Loot

[![Build and Release Artifacts](https://github.com/logwet/random-loot/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/logwet/random-loot/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This mod randomises all game loot tables deterministically using the world seed!
It works in singleplayer and in a dedicated server environment eg. for coop.
Inspired by this [site](https://fasguy.net/minecraft_randomizer/).
